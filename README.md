# v5_class_maintainance
The outline of this project is that the difficulties that are faced by the students in getting the information 
of the placement drives, project tasks, attendance requests are considered and a web application is made so that 
everyone can access it with as much ease. The project is to provide all the information like the completed. 
ongoing and upcoming drives, the tasks given in our class, the project batches and their guide name, exam time tables 
if any, contact details of the current faculty, a blog that can be accessed to go through the instructions for any drive 
registration process and other updates on drives, requesting attendance if in case they are attending any drives in the 
time of class hours and so on in one place. So, we need not waste out time recollecting or searching for all the information 
elsewhere.
